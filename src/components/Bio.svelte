<p>Hello! I'm Ashley, a software engineer currently living near Boston, MA.</p>
<p>
	Right now, I am working at{' '}
	<a

		target="_blank"
		class="link">Anaconda</a
	>, a company that specializes in data science tools, open-source software, and package management
	for Python.
</p>
<p>
	I was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, but my family relocated to Henderson, Nevada, when I was
	about eight. At seventeen, I moved to St. Louis, Missouri, to attend Washington University in St.
	Louis, where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Writing. A
	few months later, I trekked down to Austin, Texas, where I then lived for five and a half years.

<p>
	When I'm not programming, I'm usually walking or running on the various trails in and around
	Boston, meandering through the city, cooking or baking a new recipe (have recently gotten very
	into making salsa), or spending too much time on the internet. I also love traveling and taking
	photos of interesting things that I come across.

<p>
	Listening to music and going to concerts are other favorite activities of mine. Check out what
	I've been vibing with lately on
